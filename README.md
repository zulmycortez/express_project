## Levvel Technical Interview ##

### Project Setup ###
Fork the repository
Clone the forked repository and open the project locally
Run the project from the WorkSampleApplication class
The application will start on http://localhost:3001
Existing State
This is a simple node application for serving a blog.
It uses Express Framework, Mongoose, and data is stored in a Mongo database.

Currently the application has 2 endpoints:

1) To add a blog post - Post at /blog/post
2) To get a blog post by id - Get at /blog/:id
Task
Your task is to add a commenting feature.

You should add two new endpoints.

1) Post at /blog/post/{1}/comment - which should create a new comment for a post with passed {id}

2) Get at /blog/post/{1}/comment - which should return all comments for a post with passed {id}
Under the resources folder are example json files for both a Blog and a Comment.

Feel free to modify existing files or create new files. You may add new dependencies if you choose. Please follow the conventions in place throughout the project.

### Please spend no more than 4 hours on this task ###
